The authors of **WeedMaize** dataset selected fields in Badajoz, Spain (39° 1' 14,42", -6° 3' 40,69") for their experiments, capturing images in April 2020 within maize crops (Zea mays L.) at V1 and V3 growth stages. They collected these images under uncontrolled illumination conditions without any weed treatment 10 days prior. Using an "M" trajectory, they took zenithal images every 2 meters from a height of 1.3 meters. The images featured three weed species (Cyperus rotundus L., Echinochloa crus-galli L., and Solanum nigrum L.) in low growth stages (Vc and V1 or greater) alongside crop plants (Zea Mays L.). A Canon PowerShot SX540 HS camera with a resolution of 5184 px X 3886 px was used, with a shutter speed of 1/1000 and automatic ISO calibration for optimal image quality under changing lighting conditions. These images showcased both crop and weed plants in various configurations, including weeds within and between crop lines, with significant overlap between weeds and maize plants, particularly those in the V3 growth stages.

312 images were manually labeled, including an "Ve" class for unidentified emerging plants. Labeling utilized LabelImg software, saving data in PascalVOC format. It stored bounding box coordinates (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) and object class for each image.

Here is how EPPO codes for plants generally work: codes consist of 5 letters = 3 (genus) + 2 (species). For example, Alopecurus myosuroides -> ALOMY

Plant labels include SOLNI_Vc for Solanum nigrum L. at the embryonic stage, SOLNI for more developed Solanum nigrum L. plants, CYPRO_min for multi-leaf Cyperus rotundus L. plants with center-focused bounding boxes, CYPRO for single-leaf Cyperus rotundus L. plants (>V1), ECHCG for Echinochloa crus galli L., and ZEAMX for Zea mays L. plants.

The dataset was split as follows: 70% of the images formed the Training Set, while the remaining 30% comprised the Validation Set. Additionally, a random sample of 30% of the training set images constituted the Test Set, used to assess training progress. Training and validation (including testing) were performed using a GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, but due to GPU limitations, image sizes had to be reduced. This reduction involved scanning each image to generate 74 smaller sub-images, with parameters set as follows: width 3886 px, height 1926 px, and an overlap of 1900 px. The corresponding XML files defining plant labels were adjusted accordingly for each sub-image.

During scanning, some bounding boxes near the sub-image edges might have been cut, resulting in incomplete data. To ensure data integrity, these boxes were eliminated from training. The chosen large overlap during scanning ensured that if a plant was removed due to touching the edge, it would appear in the next sub-image, ensuring all plants had labels in the training set. After scanning the three image groups (training, test, and validation sets), 4368 training sub-images, 2181 validation sub-images, and 1310 test sub-images were obtained. Sub-images without bounding boxes were removed, and labeling errors were corrected by experts through visual examination. The final data set consists of 7859 sub-images with 60436 bounding boxes.
